This batch script will directly print each known SSID with its password if it was registered upon connecting to the SSID for the first time. All you need to do is double-click the .bat file, and you're good to go. No more navigating through settings to check them one by one, and no more writing commands to retrieve Wi-Fi passwords individually with long printouts of unnecessary information.
